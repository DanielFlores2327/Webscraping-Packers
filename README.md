# Webscraping-Packers
The goal of this project is to webscrape pro-football-reference to develop insights on the green bay packers 2023 season.

I am using this youtube video to help me out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JDR6jv0fGA

Next, will probably do something with nflfastR or try to get deeper into box scores for player data.
